# CEENBot
Repository for our Fall 2019 Capstone project.

Description:

Our app, BlockBot, is a teaching aid designed for young kids, K-2 (approximately). The younger age students
currently being instructed by Prairie STEM are using a software called CEENBoT Commander. CEENBoT Commander is
a block programming-like software that is used to control a robot called the CEENBoT. The software and robot
are used in conjunction to instruct students in their regular cirriculum subjects, non-cirriculum subjects
like electrical engineering, aeronotical physics, critical thinking, and more. CEENBoT Commander along with
the CEENBoT are powerful teaching aids, but can often leave youngers students lost. The software is fairly
complex, especially when younger students are able to read. Therefore, we created BlockBot for younger
students to familiarize themselves with important concepts like block programming, iterative design, spatial
reasoning, critical thinking, problem solving, and more. We do so in a simplified approach with a similar
schema to CEENBoT Commander so that the students have an easier transition into CEENBoT Commander.

Instructions:

In order to play the game in our testing/developement environment, you need to have Unity version 2019.2.7f
installed, https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive. All developers needed to remain on this version of 
Unity, otherwise there may be errors/crashes when using GitHub for version control.

Alternatively, we would have build files for the devices we are deploying to which would simply have an
executable file to start the game.

Once the game is started, I like to believe it is rather intuitive.

Step 1: Create a profile
Step 2: Select a profile to load your progress and select a level to choose
Step 3: Select the level to play and begin playing
Step 4(play): Click and drag blocks from the left hand side in order to create a block program
Step 5(play): Press the play button to test your program
Step 6(play): Repease step 4 and step 5 until the level is completed
Step 7(play): Continue to next level or go back to menu

If you go back to the main menu you must go back to go back to load profile in order to check your progress
and select a level in order to continue under your profile.
